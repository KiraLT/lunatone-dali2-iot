## Installation

```bash
pip install lunatone-dali2-iot
```

## Usage

First, create a client:

```python
from dali2iot import Client

dali_client = Client(base_url="http://192.168.1.41")

```

Now call your endpoint and use your models:

```python
from dali2iot.api.devices import get_devices_devices_get

with dali_client as client:
    devices = get_devices_devices_get.sync(client=client)

    for device in devices.devices:
        print(device.name)
```

Or do the same thing with an async version:

```python
from dali2iot.api.devices import get_devices_devices_get

async with dali_client as client:
    devices = await get_devices_devices_get.asyncio(client=client)

    for device in devices.devices:
        print(device.name)
```
